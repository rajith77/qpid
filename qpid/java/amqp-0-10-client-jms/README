This module contains a JMS implementation over the AMQP 0-10 protocol.

You could use one of the following methods to use the new client.

1. JNDI file. (Recommended approach)
=====================================
You need to use the correct Context factory.

java.naming.factory.initial = org.apache.qpid.amqp_0_10.jms.impl.jndi.PropertiesFileInitialContextFactory

The rest of the JNDI file is the same as what was before.


2. Direct use from code (not recommended).
===========================================
Use org.apache.qpid.amqp_0_10.jms.impl.ConnectionImpl to directly initiate a connection.
The old connection URL is supported.


General usage guidelines.
=========================
1. Once you obtain a connection, you should use pure JMS interfaces.

2. If you are using implementation specific classes from the old client **please change** them to use pure JMS interface methods.

3. Config options from the old client is supported where it make sense.
